# Description

The Google Colab notebook uses the imodels library to interpret these rule-based models:
- OneR rule list (OneR)
- Slipper rule set (SLIPPER)
- Optimal rule list (CORELS) 

The .dot files contain a graph representation of each model's output. The graphs can be viewed by pasting the content of the dot files in https://www.devtoolsdaily.com/graphviz/

Details on how these models work can be found in the slides included in the repo under Interpreting-Decision-Rules.pptx
